                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The goal of Book of Mormon Golf is to guess the displayed verse in as few guesses as possible.</p>
                    <p>You must first guess the book of scripture, followed by the verse.</p>
                    <p>If you correctly guess both the book and verse without running out of health, you win!</p>
                    <h3>Settings</h3>
                    <p>On desktop, the settings are always visible on the right-hand side of the page. On mobile, click the gear icon to access the game settings.</p>
                    <h4>Starting Health</h4>
